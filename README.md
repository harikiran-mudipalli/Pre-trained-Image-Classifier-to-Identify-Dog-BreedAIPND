# Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-BreedAIPND
 Mini Project from Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nano Degree
 
 To execute the project, run ``` sh run_models_batch.sh``` in terminal, on all three given architectures and compare the performance for **best** model with respect to the project goals.
 
```#TODO: 0```: Timing Code - Implement the start_time to measure total program runtime. Coding within the ```check_images.py```

# Image Classification for a City Dog Show
## Description:</br>
Your city is hosting a citywide dog show and you have volunteered to help the organizing committee with contestant registration. Every participant that registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog. The registration system tags the images based upon the biographical information.</br>
Some people are planning on registering pets that **arenâ€™t actual dogs**.</br>
You need to use an already developed ```Python``` *classifier* to make sure the participants are dogs.<br>

## Principal Objectives:
1. Correctly identify which pet images are of dogs (even if breed is misclassified) and which pet images aren't of dogs.</br>
2. Correctly classify the breed of dog, for the images that are of dogs.</br>
3. Determine which CNN model architecture (ResNet, AlexNet, or VGG), "best" achieve the objectives 1 and 2.</br>
4. Consider the time resources required to best achieve objectives 1 and 2, and determine if an alternative solution would have given a "good enough" result, given the amount of time each of the algorithms take to run.</br>

## Program Outline
- Time your program
  - Use Time Module to compute program runtime
- Get program Inputs from the user
  - Use command line arguments to get user inputs
- Create Pet Images Labels
  - Use the pet images filenames to create labels
  - Store the pet image labels in a data structure (e.g. dictionary)
- Create Classifier Labels and Compare Labels
  - Use the *Classifier* function to classify the images and create the classifier labels
  - Compare Classifier Labels to Pet Image Labels
  - Store Pet Labels, Classifier Labels, and their comparison in a complex data structure (e.g. dictionary of lists)
- Classifying Labels as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs"
  - Classify all Labels as "Dogs" or "Not Dogs" using dognames.txt file
  - Store new classifications in the complex data structure (e.g. dictionary of lists)
- Calculate the Results
  - Use Labels and their classifications to determine how well the algorithm worked on classifying images
- Print the Results
