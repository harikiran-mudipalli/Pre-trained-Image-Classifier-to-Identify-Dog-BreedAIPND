# Image Classification for a City Dog Show
## Description:</br>
Your city is hosting a citywide dog show and you have volunteered to help the organizing committee with contestant registration. Every participant that registers must submit an image of their dog along with biographical information about their dog. The registration system tags the images based upon the biographical information.</br>
Some people are planning on registering pets that **arenâ€™t actual dogs**.</br>
You need to use an already developed ```Python``` *classifier* to make sure the participants are dogs.<br>
